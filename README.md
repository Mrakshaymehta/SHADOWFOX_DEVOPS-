# 1. US Visa Prediction Project 🛂

## 1.1 Overview 🌍
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the US permits foreign workers to come to the United States to work on either a temporary or permanent basis. The act also protects US workers against adverse impacts on the workplace and maintains requirements when hiring foreign workers to fill workforce shortages. The immigration programs are administered by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).

## 1.2 Problem Statement ❗
- 🏢 OFLC processes job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications.
- 📈 Due to a significant increase in applications in the last year, OFLC requires Machine Learning models to help shortlist visa applicants based on historical data.

## 1.3 Solution 🤖
This project aims to build a **classification model** using the given dataset:
- ✅ The model predicts whether a visa will be approved or not based on applicant data.
- 🔍 It can also recommend suitable profiles for visa certification or denial based on various influencing criteria.

## 1.4 Result Attained 🏆
The best-performing model is **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)** with an accuracy of **96.66%**.
